1. What is my cache key for /api/* and why?
    Answer:
    The /api/* cache uses the lab-cache-api-disabled(created in terraform) which
    had a min_ttl=default_ttl=max_ttl=0.

    When setting it up this way CloudFront doesn't cache API responses. Since the cache key has
    no headers, no cookies, and no query strings, there's no reusauble cache. Which is a safe default
    so API responses can be dynamic, and keep it from being stale and vulnerable to data
    leaks.

2. What am I forwarding to origin and why?
    Answer:
    The /api/* origin request policy uses the lab-orp-api01(created in terraform) that 
    forwards request to the origin, so the application can function as it should.
    So, basically CloudFront forwards the request to the ALB, which would include 
    the cookies, all query strings, and the three headers("Content-Type","Origin"
    , "Host") these were included in my terraform as well.
